1. I created a navbar with menu dropdown for the UI. I chose this skill beacuse I think it is he most convenient for user interface.

2. The filter algorithm for the recommended items for each type of clothes working on adapted colors and sizes.
   I mean:

- person who wear S shirt size , I will recommended him to choose 36-40 shoes size and 30-36 pants size, in addition I will show him in the recommended items the color he chosen in the other items to create a color match.

- person who wear M-L shirt size, I will recommended him to choose 41-43 shoes size and 37-40 pants size, in addition I will show him in the recommended items the color he chosen in the other items to create a color match.

- person who wear XL-XXL shirt size I will recommended him to choose 44-46 shoes size and 41-48 pants size, in addition I will show him in the recommended items the color he chosen in the other items to create a color match.

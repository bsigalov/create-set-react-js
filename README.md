# create-set-react-native

1. I created a navbar with menu dropdown for the UI. I chose this skill beacuse I think it is he most convenient for user interface.

2.I chose bootsrap table to show the products, table is more aesthetic and clear technique to map a array for the user inteface.

3.For the filter elements I used more bootsrap techniques to sort products by colors or sizes.

4.For the life-cycle of create set, I decided to start with option to choose favorite shirt and then a cool pants and finally take a shoes to create a set. I decided to bring the user this life-cycle beacause I think it feel more real and more comfortable.

5. The filter algorithm for the recommended items for each type of clothes working on adapted colors and sizes of the first product the user selected(shirt).
   I mean:

- person who wear S shirt size , I will recommended him to choose 36-40 shoes size and 30-36 pants size, in addition I will show him in the recommended items the color he chosen in the other items to create a color match.

- person who wear M-L shirt size, I will recommended him to choose 41-43 shoes size and 37-40 pants size, in addition I will show him in the recommended items the color he chosen in the other items to create a color match.

- person who wear XL-XXL shirt size I will recommended him to choose 44-46 shoes size and 41-48 pants size, in addition I will show him in the recommended items the color he chosen in the other items to create a color match.

6.In the "My sets screen", there is a list with my design, that can show to the user all the details about this set and option to delete this set. In case the user delete a set, all the products of this set are available again.
